            <!--This is my paragraph section where I say what do I hope to
            create for my final project.-->

        <p>What I hope to create for my final project is a website for my production company. 
            Also I think it would be cool to make a website for my girlfriend 
            freelancer company as well. I think I will do one or the other for my 
            final project. I am excited for what I am going to learn in this class for sure.
