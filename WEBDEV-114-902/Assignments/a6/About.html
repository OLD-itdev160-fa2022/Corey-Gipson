                            <p>Hello, my name is Shameir aka The Tattoo Priest, and I am dedicated to giving you the very best of tattoos with a very affordable price. 
                                My main focus is to give people an fun experience while getting tatted up! </p>

                            <p>In 2012 I started taking the art and craft of tattooing seriously, I started off practicing on my older brother until I got good enough to do other people tattoos. 
                                I have came a long ways since then, and after thousands and thousands of mess ups I finally was able to get good enough to launch my own full time business in 2019. 
                                I first started out, because of my passion for art. As a kid I always loved to draw. Instead of taking notes in class, I would be drawing in my notebook (which I dont recommend. Pay Attention In School Kids!) 
                                My love for art and God has drove me to not quit in the learning process of tattooing. I am now honored to be at a place now where I can do what I love full time.</p>
                                
                            <p>I hope you enjoy the experience and the art of my tattoos as much as I enjoy offering them to you. The bible says “Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God’s grace in its various forms.”  1 Peter 4:10.  
                                I enjoy being of service to others with the gift God has giving me. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>  
  
                            <p>  Sincerely, </p>  
                                
                            <p> The Tattoo Priest</p>
