                                A new generation of young believers and pastors is making Christian tattooing more common than ever. Now you even have major artists like Justin Bieber showing off his Jesus tattoo as an honor of his faith. 
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                This is a ministry I have put together to help change the way people think about tattoos. Growing up in the church all my life, I have ran across many saints who look down upon tattoos and believe it is damaging your body, which is the “temple” that the holy spirit lives.  Though I do believe that our body is the temple and we should take care of it like the bible says. Getting tattoos or not, does not affect the amount of love God has for an individual. Here with my ministry, I teach the youth the teachings of Jesus, which is more about the person's heart than the exterior body. Our deeds we do are not good enough for God because we as people are not perfect and can never do enough good to please God. Instead it's the heart which pleases God. By us longing for him with all of our hearts is what he wants not being tattooless.

                                I began working in ministry in early 2018. Though I was really young myself, at 18,  I still wanted to push the narrative that you can still be saved and love God with tattoos. Though it's so much more common for people to have a tattoo or a couple tattoos, there is still a great percentage of “church folks” that frown upon it. Though it would be awesome to reach everyone I understand some people's minds wont change which is fine. With this ministry it is for those who want to look deeper than the things we see and instead look at the tattoos of Christ on our hearts. In the end that is what matters the most.

                            <p> 
                                In this ministry, I have a group of like minded people who all believe in showing people the works of God. We get together every week to have bible study to keep each other sharp with the word of God. We also love to serve people in our community. We do alot of community service all throughout Chicago. Our focus is to clean the hoods and to help promote stopping the violence in the city. We have also created 3 flag football leagues for the youth, teenagers, and even adults that love the game of football. Lastly, if any kid from the inner city of Chicago graduates high school with a 3.4 or higher, I will give them a free sleeve tattoo of their choice.

                                As stated before we just want to push a new narrative on what it means to live for Christ Jesus. We want to show the world that you can love God and still have fun on this earth as well like God intended us too. God judges the things we don’t see and that is the focus we want to show the world, that the stuff we see will surely pass away but the things that are unseen will last forever.
