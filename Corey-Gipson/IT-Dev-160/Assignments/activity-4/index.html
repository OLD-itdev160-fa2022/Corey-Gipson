        <h3>What's The Story?</h3>
        <p id="product-description">
            Jordan, along with former powerhouse teammates Scottie Pippin and Dennis Rodman, talk about what led up to their careers with the Chicago Bulls, and tell some detailed, behind-the-scenes stories about the experience and why it ended. Owner Jerry Reinsdorf
            and former Bulls coach Phil Jackson also share their experiences at length. Moving the conversations along is never-before-aired footage of the Bulls during Jordan's final NBA season, and a combination of recent and archived interviews with
            people like Bulls former general manager Jerry Krause, Golden Gate Warriors coach Steve Kerr, and players' mentors, friends, and family members. It also features conversations with some of the Chicago Bulls' biggest fans, including former
            U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Alongside the personal details, lots of footage of team practices, noteworthy games, and (of course) spectacular plays are included.

            <p>MJ is the greatest ever to have set foot on the court! There will be no bigger competitor and no other player that can do what he has accomplished. </p>

            <h4>Carrie Mahone</h4>
            <p>True leader, true competitor, true motivator, and loyal over everything! People often try to break down and destroy things that they don't comprehend - MJ was so resilient in how he dealt with critical situations that would have broken a lesser
                person. Have to love everything about this guy form his work ethic to his love of his family.</p>

            <p>Watching this is a flashback of my childhood and you could feel the excitement over basketball. So far the documentary has been great to watch and it seems every episode just gets better than the last. Can't wait for 9-10 & Repeat the entire
                thing back on a binge watch!! </p>

            <p>Others have had the opportunity to come into this league at a much younger age and were never able to accomplish what this man has accomplished. </p>
